										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An effective operation is run with checkpoints. The day is no different. Checkpoints provide an operational control to determine if one&#8217;s efforts are aligned with one&#8217;s intent and if one&#8217;s work is at a proper cadence, scope, impact, and quality. The first checkpoint of the day is the Daily Open.</p>
<p>Some work may come before the Daily Open, such as a chain of achievements such as from a morning routine or a set of either urgent or programmatic tasks. Work that comes before the Daily Open is execution oriented rather than reflective and orientative. The Daily Open sets the table, as it were, for the day&#8217;s actions and targeted outcomes.</p>
<p>The Daily Open originates from the previous day&#8217;s Daily Close where are draft of the Open is often drawn up. The Daily Open should take less than 10 minutes. It is a review of outstanding alerts, the day&#8217;s calendar, the calendar for the next 3 days, the execution matrixes and kanbans of active projects, and a review of one&#8217;s personal compass &#8212; which considers the condition of each personal role, value, goal, and relationship.Â The output of the Daily Open is an updated calendar and a Cue Card.</p>
<p>Journaling, exercising, breakfast, meditation, scripture study and the study of other inspiring texts, are done prior to the Daily Open so that the mind is conditioned properly prior to updating the calendar and creating the Cue Card.</p>

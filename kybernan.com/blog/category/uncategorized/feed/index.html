<p>A good model to have when thinking about personal goals is to not that there are three types of goals: Those with a simple objectives, those with rugged ranges of objectives, and those with dynamic objectives. The other concept to keep in mind is that we are always trading off the following:</p>



<ul><li>Viability vs sacrifice </li><li>Engineering vs providence</li><li>Vision vs learning</li></ul>



<p>Viability is immediate success. Some times we cannot afford to wait. We have to be good enough as we adapt and improve or else we will not be allowed to continue to pursue a goal. Viability is also sustainability. When a goal is not funding itself, then one must sacrifice in order to continue to pursue it. One must plan, but one must also act. In both situations, there will be randomness, things that are uncontrolled, and luck, and there will also be intelligence and forethought, laws and natural consequences. Lastly, when one has vision then this is the result of their current understanding, but as they learn then the vision needs to evolve.  So while vision will support persistence it can also harm getting to a new peak if vision is not susceptible to change.</p>

<p>When considering how to process items from a notebook, split out those things that are worth archiving from those things that can be actively applied. Kinetic items are those items you can take action on. </p>



<p>On the other hand, potential value builds as you reflect and review, integrate and cross-reference with good citations, those things in an archived folder. The key to building potential value is a good referencing system and quality notes with very low noise to signal ratios.</p>



<p>Archives are of great long term potential value, but of even greater value, because they develop us are those things which can be immediately used. The one is the flour and the other the leaven. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Part of the benefit of using a notebook habitually and with skill comes from it being the first step in four different workflows: </p>



<ol><li>Journal writing workflow</li><li>Asset development workflow</li><li>Task management workflow</li><li>Contact management workflow</li></ol>



<p>These four workflows, because they originate with capturing things and reflecting on ideas in a notebook often get conflated, but as you will note, in the previous post I wrote about the &#8220;Notebooking&#8221; process, after capture and continuous revision, the next activity is to sort what was captured. Sorting what was captured means to vector the content into the right workflow, only then can the content be persisted in the right repository. (This is the reason the database has multiple instances). </p>



<p>While some may wish for a single repository, and there may be a way to do it, I think each of the workflows are so different that the benefits of integrating the workflows into a single repository are dwarfed by the schema challenges. The primary benefit I see in a single repository is that it would enable a rich global search function. However, how I would interact with the input and cueing tools of one workflow is very different than how and why I would update and investigate or search a repository associated one of the other three workflows. </p>



<p>That these different workflows interact or overlap is certain. For example, I may want my tasks accomplished to be included automatically added into my journal, perhaps as a clever way to create a dynamic prompt for each day.  Another example: I may want to share information across my contact management and task management workflows without having to enter it twice. Yet another example, I may want to build project templates into reusable assets and then use them to frame or define the tasks I need to be working on. However, automation is a far better solution for these and other use cases than consolidation.</p>



<p>Because these are integrated and not consolidated workflows it creates problems for people when they conflate them or fail to differentiate them. It leaves them wondering how to make their task management tool also  support journaling adequately or it makes them want their task management tool to include a mindmap so that it can double as a concept management tool in order for them to develop ideas sufficient to eventually build out an asset of some kind. Inevitably, this leads to dissatisfaction with different tools to manage the digital content and inconsistent notebooking because the value is eroded since the right path was not taken to move the content from the notebook to a digital repository and without the content becoming digital the ability to use it and to improve it does not scale over time or scope, nor is it sustainable in the face of complexity or haste. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I wrestled with whether I should keep a physical notebook or take my ideas straight to digital. It seemed so much more efficient to capture and explore my ideas digitally from the start.</p>



<p>But, in the end, I found a physical notebook more flexible. I can do a mind map without having to find and launch the mindmap app (or find the related mindmap file I might want to augment). I can capture a task without having to get the task management app open and so get to work on a task a bit faster. I can start working on a chart without having to pick a graphics app. I don&#8217;t have to launch and orient on Scrivner, on Tinderbox, or some other app.</p>



<p>A physical notebook never needs a charge (the pen does need ink), it can be dropped without concern, and it can be replaced for a lot less money.  </p>



<p>Side note:  A physical notebook and a computer are not mutually exclusive. I have a phone, and if I have something that makes sense to capture digitally, then I use it. If I am in a setting, like a dinner party, I just use my phone to capture and explore ideas.  If I am moving along, I use a voice recorder and text-to-speech. If I am online then I capture using my computer. I might do some initial exploring or note gathering in a notebook on the side, but if the webpage, or whatever digital content I am reading, is interesting, then it gets captured digitally and only digitally. Some people use Evernote to do this, I use DevonThink.  </p>



<p>All of the above is true, but, for me, the most important quality a physical notebook offers me is that it allows me to draft page after page of ideas without cluttering up my computer. The sad truth is many of my ideas are not worth saving. This is the same for all of us. Some of our initial thinking is not as insightful as some of our later thinking. I can put my raw ideas into a file, and then another file, and another, and another. I can try to get them just right. If I do that, then I will slow down my thinking and I will have a painful experience trying to curate the mess. There will be so many weaker notes with the same keywords as my more thoughtful notes, that search will be impaired. These second rate notes will add straw to the stack I have to get through before finding my needle. On the other hand, if I write my ideas in a physical notebook, and waste page after page trying to get to a well-formed idea (or two), and then transfer only the well-considered ideas to my computer, I leave behind the draft ideas (or daft ideas) and only the needles get persisted digitally. Search is cleaner. I save my notebooks in case I ever get the itch to go back to my original ideas and when I do I  have a simple chronology physically arrayed without having to worry about sorting by created date or modified date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whatever notebook you like the most is the right one for you. But how to know which is best is a question. Below are the notebook features I consider when making my choice:</p>



<ol><li>Price: A good notebook should not cost more than $15 and more often than not can be had for under $8.</li><li>Size: While I prefer an 8.25&#215;5 notebook with about 150 sheets, this preference varies under different conditions. Almost always the 8.25&#215;5 size strikes the right balance between portability and ideation. The 8.25&#215;5 is close enough to the ISO A5 standard and I&#8217;ve never had any issue switching between them. Going with a standard in the industry makes finding the next notebook easy and cheap.  That said, some times, like others, I am very task oriented or traveling light and in those situations a deck of 3&#215;5 index cards bound by a butterfly clip is my preferred notebook. Obviously, anyone with borderline hypographia is going to want a bigger book with more paper. Usually, people who prefer notebooks with a spiral binding also prefer a slightly larger book. For others a reporter&#8217;s notebook is ideal. During my undergraduate years a reporter&#8217;s notebook worked very well. My father, who, for a time, evaluated training tactics and equipment for the US Army, found the reporter&#8217;s notebook ideal.  </li><li>Binding quality: When the glue fails and the pages fall out, its lame. Good quality materials usually, like birds, flock together. If the paper is good, then the binding usually is solid. Always check to see if the paper is held with string and glue or only glue. If you don&#8217;t see any string binding the pages, then replace the notebook carefully on the store shelf since you might have to buy it if you break it. Binding quality should not be ignored if you are buying a spiral notebook. Cheap wire snags, can easily get stretched out and pinch the paper, and unless you are careful can make turning pages a chore.</li><li>Binding style: For some the spiral notebook is preferred, but not for me. I prefer a soft cover because of the way I some times carry my pen in the book, but I am fine with a hard cover if that is what is available.</li><li>Paper quality: The is a lot to be said about paper quality. Bleed through and feathering are painful for those using a fountain pen. Once I find a good enough notebook, I try to stay with it for as long as the price is right. Dry time and smudging are another consideration for both fountain pen and rollerball users. Lastly, ghosting and indentations from one page to the one under it are not a concern at all for me because I use a fountain pen, but writers using a ballpoint, rollerball, or pencil may find paper thickness important depending on how hard they press when they write.</li><li>Pagination: Some bullet journal diehards think not having page numbers is a feature, most of us however, see it as a bug. I prefer pagination because when I fill up a notebook, I like to review the content and create an index for the more interesting ideas or specific data. I leave the first few pages blank when I start a notebook and then put the page number and a short note about the idea or what the data is (e.g. password and user name for a membership somewhere) so that if I ever want to retrieve the data or review the original musings on a given topic I simply look at the index created in the front. The back pages can be used as well or instead of the front. </li><li>Page layout: A blank page with a number at the bottom is my ideal because it allows there is no steering of my mind when I engage the page. Dots and graphs are a close second and for some people these are preferred because they offer guidance when needed but don&#8217;t confront creativity when the writing runs counter to a traditional book or doodles cover the page. Lines are only good to help with penmanship, so in that case, I prefer narrower spacing to wider spacing. Two other aspects of layout have to do with prompts and  layout templates (usually a few boxes of various sizes). For prompts and layouts, I will often use the first few pages, after the index, to write out templates and prompts, then I look in the front to be reminded.  This way each page is its own blank slate and I can turn it into a template if that is the destiny of the page, but if not, then the page is free to be used in whatever way is required</li><li>Page count: As mentioned earlier about 150 sheets works for me, that is about 300 pages and so gets me through about a month and a half. If I were in school I might want more paper, or, I might want to add a dedicated notebook for each class that is notes-intensive.</li><li>Bookmark: I prefer to use an index card or my pen to mark my place, but the tassel never gets in my way.  This is perhaps the least important to me but it is a good tie breaker if I ever need one. For some however, this little strip of cloth is used daily. You can also buy these at local stationary stores if you find them indispensable but can find a notebook with one that is perfect in every other way.</li><li>Corners: I prefer rounded corners to pointed ones. While all I have to do is pound the corner into the floor and it soon gets rounded, usually that damages the glue keeping the cover in place and shortens the life of the cover.</li><li>Closure strap: This is a must for me.  It can be leather or elastic. It is primarily about holding the pen. A strap can hold the pen on top with a standard closure pattern where the strap runs from top to bottom as is with a traditional Moleskin. A strap can hold the pen on the side with a cross closure pattern where the strap wraps either across the middle or diagonally from top to bottom with a twist across the middle. If the cover is soft, then instead of the pen being on the side it can be inside against the spine with the notebook pressing against it as the strap traces any closure pattern. Lastly, the closure strap can run on or through a leather pen case with a standard closure pattern. </li><li>Back pocket: I love notebooks with a back inside pocket. There is no better place to keep receipts when I am traveling. Another benefit of the pocket is that is provides a place to keep a six inch metal ruler. I find the ruler comes in handy and you may too.</li><li>Refills and fit: Eventually you use up all the paper. Acquiring the next replacement, whether a filler or a new bound book should be anticipated. This is why the 8.25&#215;5 is a sustainable solution for me. They are a little more wasteful than just getting paper refills due to the cover, but they are ubiquitous and far more available than refills. Furthermore, they are not only often cheaper than refills, but I have found refills don&#8217;t have as consistent of a design specification so they vary widely in size and quality and they are a real pain to archive when compared with bound notebooks.   </li><li>Archiving used notebooks: Having bound notebooks of the same size and of good quality makes it easy to store them on a shelf and archive them. Years later you can review them, keep them, consolidate them, augment your journal with them, or burn them. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t do this and some of my early notebooks were poorly considered and many were lost over time.</li><li>Cover preferences: For some they like bright colors or images and they often like variations but for me, I like my leather notebook cover sleeve. My daughter and wife gave me a leather notebook sleeve for Christmas one year and I love it. It makes even my cheap notebooks look good. Also, whenever I get a free notebook it doesn&#8217;t matter whose brand is on it (could be a competitor) the brand is never seen but the notebook is fully used. Also because I use a sleeve, the actual quality of the cover is less important. It still matters because as I said quality in one part of the notebook usually means quality in other areas.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I write with a fountain pen because it is more fun to use one, enables more nuance, fatigues me less, conveys my personal style more, opens up conversations, helps me to better express myself, is more mechanically interesting, provides a distraction when I want one, is more appealing to hold and to behold, and ultimately encourages me to write more.  </p>



<p>If that is why I write with a fountain pen, then what are the features of the pen that accomplish those outcomes? Here are some ideas:</p>



<ul><li>Fountain pen parts are interesting to me. In an odd way, when I disassemble the pen, I feel greater appreciation for its engineering, the quality of its parts, and the mechanics of how ink is delivered to the page. For whatever reason, I feel a greater attachment to the pen. It is exactly the opposite with ballpoint pens. When I look inside one of those, I see a cheap teeny-tinny spring, an ugly tube of plastic or steel holding the ink, and usually one or more pieces of metal or cheap plastic that inevitably pop out and fall to the ground. I have never felt greater appreciation for a rollerball or ballpoint after taking it apart, replacing the ink cartridge, and putting it back together. I have felt greater appreciation for fountain pens when I have disassembled them and put them back together.</li><li>The physics of a fountain pen are more interesting to me. A ballpoint pen seems like the product of the industrial revolution. Ink is forced into a chamber, pressurized, and the smallest parts are smashed together in a miracle of engineering with the design drivers being ubiquitous use, minimum unit cost, and a mandate for rapid product obsolesce. I am not being sarcastic when I refer to the miracle of engineering involved in balled pens. It is amazing to me how these pens are made. But, a fountain pen seems to have been been the product of the renaissance rather than the industrial revolution. Instead of mass production and lowest cost objectives, the wonder of science and capillary action drives the design of fountain pens. Rather than how to raise the margin on disposable refills, the engineering of fountain pens seems more concerned with the nature of vacuums, nib quality, and the mechanics of pistons. With fountain pens, the design priorities seem primarily concerned with the physics of nature and with  heirloom qualities such as romance, inheritance, distinction, and beauty. </li><li>Because a fountain pen delivers ink to the page through capillary action rather than pressure &#8212; as is required to roll the ball or rub off the lead &#8212; there is less fatigue when I write. Writing for hours never results in the cramped fingers and stiffness caused by gripping the instrument hard in order to push it down and hold it firm in order to leave the desired marks.</li><li>More line variation due to nib sizes and more line variation with softer nibs great type differentiation is possible and so more nuances can be communicated. Line variation can help convey importance, highlight certain notes or ideas, and help to establish structure and hierarchy. Line variations also make doodling more fun and engaging.</li><li>A fountain pen, because it requires maintenance and because I have to slightly adjust my writing motion based on each pen, as well as pay more attention to ink and paper, it improves my discipline. I can always use a little more discipline in my life, especially if the thing that leads to more discipline, concurrently leads to more pleasure.</li><li>I feel more responsible when I use a fountain pen, not only because I am taking care of an asset instead of trifle, but also, in the case of pistons and converters, the pen is better for the environment. I am not adding to landfills plastic sleeves empty of ink or sleeves filled with ink because of a stuck ball. </li><li>There is an 80/20 rule with fountain pens that goes the other way (20/80) with other pen types: I can repair a fountain pen 80% of the time, where other pen types I can only repair 20% of the time. I like to be able to fix things, so that&#8217;s a plus. </li><li>A Bic pen or some other form factor where the production volume is measure by the millions and the unit cost is always under pressure to go lower, will never have the beauty of a Pelikan or a Visconti, a Platinum or a Sailor or a Maki-e Pilot. There are a few nice rollerballs, but almost always they are modeled after a fountain pen that preceded it, but more importantly, the flaring of a nib is always more beautiful than what sticks out of the hole on a ballpoint pen. </li><li>Those who use a fountain pen are more often seen as more creative, more professional, and more interested in beauty and expression. I like those qualities so I like using a writing instrument that channels those traits.</li><li>Part of my enjoyment with fountain pens is the physical pleasure I get by the sound when a steel nib scratches the page as it lays down ink. Some people like the sharp and pointed feedback they feel from a steel nib, I really like the sound. But, even more, I like the stealth of a soft gold nib that glides across the page with no feedback to my hand as the ink slips gracefully from nib to paper.</li><li>As I mentioned earlier, using a fountain pen requires some skill to maintain it, to ink it, to clean it, to repair it, and to adjust or tune the nib. With skill comes a sense of confidence and positive pride. Skills don&#8217;t need to be hard to develop in order to contribute to a positive self-regard, they just require efficacy as they are called into use regularly. It also helps if others want to learn the skills and we get a chance to teach them.</li><li>Using a fountain pen improves my appreciation for quality paper and more gratitude is a good thing.  </li><li>Fountain pens force me to write with confidence since if I pause, I puddle ink. This little quirk of the pen means that as I write I am more interested in getting ideas down then I am with getting them perfect. It also means that if I need to pause to think through my ideas, then I need to pull the pen from the page and take a proper pause. It means, I break or I flow, but I don&#8217;t pause in some middle ground.</li><li>I am also a person who likes to finish things so when I see my ink running low, it encourages me to write. I want to get to closure by getting to the last drop of ink.</li><li>Another odd reason fountain pens are mechanically more interesting to me is because shaking the pen matters. Whenever someone shakes a ballpoint or rollerball, you know that is about as effective as talking to a computer when you are worried that your document didn&#8217;t get saved before the system crashed. But, shaking a fountain pen works. As does carefully putting pressure on the point of the nib and tracing a figure-eight at just the right angle. </li><li>I like the infinite range of color options that are easily acquired and almost never require me to change my pen. This characteristic of fountain pens means I can get the pen I really like, get better and better at using that particular pen, and then just change out the ink whenever I feel I want a change. I also like to mix my own inks and see what happens. There is no utility in mixing ink, but its fun to see the new color, and its a color that may never be seen again. The variety of colors means I can be purpose-driven. I can use red when I edit or correct my writing, blue or black when I am taking notes, and switch between pens with different inks when I want to differentiate with color my doodles, diagrams, and data.</li><li>I do not know if it improves my penmanship, but a lot of people say writing with a fountain pen will &#8212; so because I have no reason to doubt them, writing with a fountain pen gives me a little more hope that I will improve. This hope inspires me to try harder at my penmanship and to write more. This probably means it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</li><li>The history of fountain pens and the great people who have used them inspires me. Who doesn&#8217;t want to channel Mark Twain, Winston Churchill, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Anne Frank, Stephen King, Oprah Winfrey, Hemingway, Charlie Chapman, Dwight Eisenhower, Walt Disney, Albert Einstein, and many other great thinkers when they write &#8212; at least at times.</li><li>The right pen reinforces my sense of style and it becomes a token or artifact to help convey it. I hope this is not a peacock move, but rather is an honest effort to share a little about myself without being ostentatious. </li><li>There is a community that is welcoming and wise. There are craftsmen, nib meisters, trainers, vlogs, demonstrators, reviewers, collectors, and many other specialists and enthusiasts. There are pen shows and there are active secondary markets on eBay, Etsy, and elsewhere. All of these contribute to a lower cost of entry, less risk, and more enjoyment. </li></ul>



<p>I worry that by the time I finished writing about why I like fountain pens, the reader might wonder if I am blind to every other option. I am not. Ballpoint pens and rollerballs, just like markers, highlighters, and mechanical pencils are still required, they still have their place, but they not my preferred tool whenever a fountain pen will do.</p>



<p>By the way, there are several things I hate about fountain pens. I can&#8217;t stand a dry start, writing while in transit is often unmanageable, I am often disappointed by the price of a good pen, nibs are expensive, really hard to fix, and I have ruined a couple of them, small converters require refills too often, longer trips require bringing a good rollerball pen as a backup anyway, dropping the pen can cost hundreds of dollars especially if it bends the nib, quality paper is more the exception than the norm, and many manufactures won&#8217;t agree to a common set of manufacturing standards nor allow nibs to be swapped which creates waste and shortens the lifespan of a pen &#8212; I avoid buying pens made by those knuckleheads. </p>



<p>But, life is about trade-offs and, on the whole, I am much happier &#8220;notebooking&#8221; with fountain pens than with other instruments.</p>

<p>The better a tool works for a job, the more we use it for the job. Likewise, the better we get at using a tool, the better it works for the job.  But, there is a funny thing that happens with productivity tools for some of us: the more we feel our personal style is expressed through the tools we use, the more we use them. Of course, this applies to more than just productivity tools, musical instruments and trouser belts also come to mind. So, what follows is a discussion of the pen, paper, apps, and accessories that are both functionally strong and personally meaningful. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the pen or in my case pens. For me, I prefer fountain pens and I prefer to have two pens when I am chair-bound (at work, at church, at home, on a plane, meditating in nature) but I only have one pen as part of my every day carry (EDC). </p>



<p>I use blue or black ink in my EDC pen and green or red ink in the other pen. This contrast allows me to write, doodle, and highlight efficiently. The marginal return for two pens is barely positive so I often leave one when I am traveling light and the marginal return goes deeply negative when a third pen is added. It&#8217;s a hassle to manage fountain pens, clean them, keep straight what color ink is in what pen, and it ultimately, for me, having more than two pens, except in rare situations, conflicts with my personal style.</p>



<p>I am not a fountain pen connoisseur, but I have my preferences. I prefer an extra-fine tip on my primary pen, and a fine or medium tip on the second.  I prefer a lot of ink in the first so it is a piston filled pen. I prefer more control and more variety in the second, so it uses a converter.  </p>



<p>For more detail see my related posts where I go into detail on fountain pens, mechanical pencils, ballpoints, and highlighters.  </p>



<p>It is important when it comes to pens, that you find what works best for you. Do you like the style, mechanics, and versatility of a fountain pen? Do you prefer the permanency of ink or the forgiveness of lead? Is there something about mechanical pencils you love? Do you like the economy of ballpoint pens or the way they write? Is highlighting an important part of how you review or group data? These are your questions. Explore your options. It won&#8217;t cost you much. You can get a really good fountain pen and ink for under $70 USD and determine if you want to go for a more expensive fountain pen because you found it was clearly your preferred tool. You can try dozens of pens and pencils and still not spend very much. </p>



<p>The key is to find a writing instrument (or two) that really works for you.  Like dating, find your match and then, don&#8217;t worry about it again. </p>

<p>One of the ways to improve B=MAT, see the previous post where I discuss the Fogg behavior model, is to understand the overall lifecycle of taking notes and sketching ideas.  The lifecycle helps to convey integrated activities that can result in greater short-term, near-term, and long-term value. Having a clear workflow or lifecycle enables me to inventory my tools and develop tool-specific skills so that I can efficiently gain the benefits.</p>



<p>In future posts, I will talk about the tools used at each step.</p>

<p>I could spend a lot of time talking about the benefits of keeping a notebook. I could go on about the value of capturing information, capturing tasks (see GTD), thinking visually, exploring ideas, increasing our working memory, finding connections, improving memory, using doodling to record dreams as a mechanism to improve lucidity, greater sustained focus on a direction of thought, or another dozen advantages, and I probably will, but not now, right now I want to start talking about the habit of keeping a notebook by applying the Fogg Behavior model which is B=M*A*T to it. In other words, I want to suggest how to make &#8220;notebooking&#8221; a more entrenched and consistent habit by improving Motivation, Abilities, and Triggers. </p>



<p>This model means if you want to get better at consistently writing in a notebook then consider your motivation to keep a notebook, your ability to do so, and what triggers could be used to cue you to make notes. </p>



<p>One quick and dirty exercise is to individually score your motivation, ability, and trigger landscape on a scale of 1-5 and improve the lowest score (the bottleneck approach) or improve the highest score (the appreciative inquiry approach).  </p>



<p>You might also take the lowest two and see if there is a two-fer change you could make. For example, I found that learning to think in terms of lists and in terms of a few key diagrams (Venn, systems, quadrant, and timeline) had a direct impact on my ability and in turn on my motivation &#8211; because I saw more value in using my notebook. </p>



<p>Another two-fer is a good pen. Not only does a good fountain pen make it more enjoyable to take notes, but it is a conversational piece and since I like conversations it increased both my ability (faster notetaking and use of type/font) as well as my motivation. </p>



<p>One last two-fer example has to do with that my daughter and wife gave me for Christmas a few years ago. The gave me a nice leather cover that I now use for my notebooks. The cover slips over my notebooks, and now I don&#8217;t get my current notebook confused with other notebooks on my desk, my notebooks don&#8217;t fall about as much, I can keep a pen more easily with my notebook (I lose fewer pens), and I more enjoy having my notebook with me as part of my every day carry (EDC).</p>

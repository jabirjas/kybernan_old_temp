										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Control measures are actions or artifacts designed to do two things: 1) to prevent, eliminate or reduce the occurrence of a hazard and 2) to orchestrate behavior and reinforce performance  qualities. At least one control measure should be applied to any deliberate project or change initiative.</p>
<p>When the United States Army controls operations, from a small two man fire team to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_group">Army Group</a>, it uses control measures. Checkpoints, phase lines, execution matrixes, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_line">FEBAs</a> are examples used by the military. Controls mitigate risk, exploit opportunities, and focus execution. Control Measures are not limited to organizational level objectives. They are profitably used to accelerate personal improvement and productivity.</p>
<p>Examples of personal productivity control measures include Pomodoros, Cue Cards, checklists, color coded calendar blocks, project plans, video recordings, and a portfolio matrix.</p>
<p>Control measures should scale in multiple directions without adding cost or time. For example, almost no variation control measures should handle large complex projects, deep personal change, and both ambiguous and well defined objectives. Above all control measures must be efficient and not engender costs of any kind. Costs may be financial, mental, physical, social, or related to how quickly work can be accomplished.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Control measures are actions or artifacts designed to do two things: 1) to prevent, eliminate or reduce the occurrence of a hazard and 2) to orchestrate behavior and reinforce performance  qualities. At least one control measure should be applied to any deliberate project or change initiative.</p>
<p>When the United States Army controls operations, from a small two man fire team to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_group">Army Group</a>, it uses control measures. Checkpoints, phase lines, execution matrixes, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_line">FEBAs</a> are examples used by the military. Controls mitigate risk, exploit opportunities, and focus execution. Control Measures are not limited to organizational level objectives. They are profitably used to accelerate personal improvement and productivity.</p>
<p>Examples of personal productivity control measures include Pomodoros, Cue Cards, checklists, color coded calendar blocks, project plans, video recordings, and a portfolio matrix.</p>
<p>Control measures should scale in multiple directions without adding cost or time. For example, almost no variation control measures should handle large complex projects, deep personal change, and both ambiguous and well defined objectives. Above all control measures must be efficient and not engender costs of any kind. Costs may be financial, mental, physical, social, or related to how quickly work can be accomplished.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perception is the first critical skill for productivity. Without perception all effective work is happenchance.</p>
<p>Perception has two primary manifestations: the ability to perceive things as they really are and the ability to see viable options for achieving outcomes.</p>
<p>Perception is impacted by desire and character in both good and bad ways. Without desire the search for options will be limited to the most obvious ones. If desire is greater than one&#8217;s moral character, it is easy for reality to be blurred by ambition and one&#8217;s false hope will overrun rigorous hope, which will ultimately lead the soul to failure. Strong moral character bridling passions is a necessary, albeit insufficient, requirement. It is love and concern for others above selfishness that help to ensure moral character bridles passions sufficiently to ensure things are seen as they really are and hopes are grounded on truth rather than unproductive fantasy.</p>
<p>Knowledge, worldviews, experience, and language improve perception because they help with pattern recognition.</p>
<p>A skilled and honorable team also help because perception is best when complemented by perspective. The insights of others provide perspective and improve perception. Just as the binocular aspect of our eyes enable depth perception by integrating two perspectives, so it is with teams. Teams, when properly constituted in character, understanding, ambition, and rigor, can avoid groupthink and provide valuable perspective and magnify our ability to perceive the matters at hand and yet on the horizon.</p>

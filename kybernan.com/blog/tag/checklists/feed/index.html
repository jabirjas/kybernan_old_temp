										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Checklists improve productivity because when used properly they do four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable effective and efficient quality control</li>
<li>Enable effective and efficient communication of status and context</li>
<li>Improve learning</li>
<li>Enable faster work</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a set of ideas to check work for both quality and scope means one can bounce their focus between doing the work and checking the work much more efficiently. Here is where some of the greatest psychological benefits come from. Checklists for checking work do not need to be comprehensive. They can be a concise guide to general or specific areas that need focus or a quality control checklist can be a long detailed list. If a short list, then those items that make the list are those with the highest joint score of first the importance of the area to successful mission accomplishment both in terms of the objective value of the task or task group and their impact on the person&#8217;s mental and emotional framing of the work, and second, the challenge for the person using the checklist to recall the item.</p>
<p>Using checklists makes it possible to effectively sharing status and ensuring when others engage they engage with full context.</p>
<p>The first aspect of learning involves documentation. Checklists serve as documentation frameworks and through re-use make documentation more robust while simultaneously requiring less time.  Also, when used properly, checklists are changed as soon as improvements are identified which means institutional knowledge is captured and retained.</p>
<p>One can go faster because sequencing and work structure breakdowns become trivial. The benefits of learning along with the documentation of best practice is combined with quality control, faster also means useful automation. The first step towards automation involves building an algorithm for the task.</p>
<p>Checklists can be used for training and for production. They can be as detailed as a set of instructions for assembling furniture or as general as the cardinal values of a corporation. They can be a short list or 3 items to focus the mind and heart or a long list of hundreds to guide someone through a complex technical project. The one area where checklists fail is when they are done mindlessly.</p>
<p>The maxim is true, &#8220;the worst thing someone can do is to fail to follow a  proven checklist and the worst thing someone can do is fail to question rigorously a checklist.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An effective operation is run with checkpoints. The day is no different. Checkpoints provide an operational control to determine if one&#8217;s efforts are aligned with one&#8217;s intent and if one&#8217;s work is at a proper cadence, scope, impact, and quality. The first checkpoint of the day is the Daily Open.</p>
<p>Some work may come before the Daily Open, such as a chain of achievements such as from a morning routine or a set of either urgent or programmatic tasks. Work that comes before the Daily Open is execution oriented rather than reflective and orientative. The Daily Open sets the table, as it were, for the day&#8217;s actions and targeted outcomes.</p>
<p>The Daily Open originates from the previous day&#8217;s Daily Close where are draft of the Open is often drawn up. The Daily Open should take less than 10 minutes. It is a review of outstanding alerts, the day&#8217;s calendar, the calendar for the next 3 days, the execution matrixes and kanbans of active projects, and a review of one&#8217;s personal compass &#8212; which considers the condition of each personal role, value, goal, and relationship. The output of the Daily Open is an updated calendar and a Cue Card.</p>
<p>Journaling, exercising, breakfast, meditation, scripture study and the study of other inspiring texts, are done prior to the Daily Open so that the mind is conditioned properly prior to updating the calendar and creating the Cue Card.</p>

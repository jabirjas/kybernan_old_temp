										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Checklists improve productivity because when used properly they do four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable effective and efficient quality control</li>
<li>Enable effective and efficient communication of status and context</li>
<li>Improve learning</li>
<li>Enable faster work</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a set of ideas to check work for both quality and scope means one can bounce their focus between doing the work and checking the work much more efficiently. Here is where some of the greatest psychological benefits come from. Checklists for checking work do not need to be comprehensive. They can be a concise guide to general or specific areas that need focus or a quality control checklist can be a long detailed list. If a short list, then those items that make the list are those with the highest joint score of first the importance of the area to successful mission accomplishment both in terms of the objective value of the task or task group and their impact on the person&#8217;s mental and emotional framing of the work, and second, the challenge for the person using the checklist to recall the item.</p>
<p>Using checklists makes it possible to effectively sharing status and ensuring when others engage they engage with full context.</p>
<p>The first aspect of learning involves documentation. Checklists serve as documentation frameworks and through re-use make documentation more robust while simultaneously requiring less time.  Also, when used properly, checklists are changed as soon as improvements are identified which means institutional knowledge is captured and retained.</p>
<p>One can go faster because sequencing and work structure breakdowns become trivial. The benefits of learning along with the documentation of best practice is combined with quality control, faster also means useful automation. The first step towards automation involves building an algorithm for the task.</p>
<p>Checklists can be used for training and for production. They can be as detailed as a set of instructions for assembling furniture or as general as the cardinal values of a corporation. They can be a short list or 3 items to focus the mind and heart or a long list of hundreds to guide someone through a complex technical project. The one area where checklists fail is when they are done mindlessly.</p>
<p>The maxim is true, &#8220;the worst thing someone can do is to fail to follow a  proven checklist and the worst thing someone can do is fail to question rigorously a checklist.&#8221;</p>

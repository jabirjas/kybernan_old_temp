										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Daily Close and the Daily Clean work hand in hand. The Clean finishes up the residual tasks. The Daily Clean is when project documentation is reviewed and updated, any unanswered emails handled, any end of day calls made, and any commitments or promptings completed or scheduled. Because every system falls towards entropy, the Daily Clean is required to tidy-up the work, to bookmark (including documentation aids) incomplete work so that it can be effectively and efficiently reengaged, and to sharpen any tools for the coming day.</p>
<p>The Daily Close supports five critical areas of personal productivity: learning which requires reflection, clarity, persistence, readiness which requires problem analysis and bookmarking, and, lastly, gains consolidation.</p>
<p>A quick word about problem analysis: the Daily Close is a time when questions which make choosing prioritize difficult are found and raised for consideration and when the seeds for multiple courses of action planted. The Daily Close is not the time to consider the problem or define multiple courses of action, it is the time to identify what problems will be considered, what are the components of the problem, and what are the core differences in various courses of action. The time for proper consideration, analysis, and planning comes after the Daily Close &#8212; perhaps in dreams or in a future block of time.</p>
<p>The Daily Close is quick and should not take more than 10 minutes. The Cue Card and calendar of the day are assessed and the calendar for the next 10 days is reviewed. The Daily Close&#8217;s outputs are:  a draft of the next day&#8217;s Cue Card, and an updated calendar. The inputs to the Daily Close are the day&#8217;s Cue card, notebook, index of active projects, waiting for list, values index, active goal list, and target roles.</p>
<p>Meditation, journaling, thank you cards, and scripture study, are all encouraged but are not part of the Daily Close.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too many simultaneously attempted changes lower the odds for real and lasting change. To change one&#8217;s life permanently, requires one to change their identity, how they see themselves. This requires reworking existing aspects of our personality, defining and integrating new aspects of our personality, and reworking the whole of our personality so that its parts are coherent and mutually reinforcing. It requires understanding how and why we have optimized ourselves in such a way that requires a change. We are all doing the best we can so we have all optimized our lives in unconscious ways and to make a conscious change will require untangling, dissolving and reengineering the whole system.</p>
<p>To make lasting change, to change at the level of our identity, requires understanding the future oppositional forces we will face and the sacrifices we will need to make in order to honor the changes we seek. It will require us to develop risk management strategies which include avoidance tactics, contingencies, and recovery strategies. All of which may require resources. Worth noting, meditation and prayer are critical for real change. Each provides the aiming and slotting in of the new and the adjusting the old so the change is well placed and so that antibodies do not destroy the desired change. Prayer also provides the petition and faith required to fully open the windows of heaven and for the individual to receive the redeeming and exalting power of God. Prayer helps to temper the energy of change so that the character is improved rather than compromised by ambition.</p>
<p>Consequently, making more than one change at a time is hard. Doing a dozen at once is impossible &#8212; too many moving parts for the human soul to refactor consciously. Instead, focus on the one next thing. Define it, shape it, understand it, get a deep feel for it, let it permeate all aspects of who I am. Then, when the change is integrate and part of my identity, when dross has risen amidst the furnace of change and has been sloughed off, then, and only then, look to the next change. Not only will the next change be more likely, but the direction more true. It is more likely because the last successful change will naturally produce more confidence that change is possible and a better understanding of what is required so when the next change is undertaken it will more likely happen. The next change will also more likely be the right change and be in the right direction because the selection, framing, and definition of the next change as well as the acceptable sacrifices and optimal risk management plans, will all have the advantage of being considered from higher ground. Because they will be shaped by the previous change, the improvements realized from the last change will inform and inspire the making and management of the next change.</p>
<p>Metaphorically, making a change to one gear in a machine optimized for the current grind requires making sure existing gears are adjusted and work together with the new gear or transformed gear. This is no small feat. It requires the agony of repentance and the hope of salvation. It requires being willing to lose one&#8217;s competence for a season in order to achieve a higher plane of competence. Continuous improvement is repeating this painful and rewarding cycle again and again. Immersion and the loss of one&#8217;s self in a noble cause while in the company of honorable friends and conditioned by daily prayer and scripture study, seem to provide the riches environments for positive change, not only because of their encouragement but also because of their channeling effects and, with regard to losing one&#8217;s self, it is easier for the dross to rise and for the existing gears that might not be the best shape for the system to be modified when serving others is the focus rather than the preserving of various aspects of one&#8217;s pre-change identity.</p>
